Integrity constraints\n00:33 - 01:20\nIntegrity constraints can roughly be divided into three types. The most simple ones are probably the so-called attribute constraints. For example, a certain attribute, represented through a database column, could have the integer data type, allowing only for integers to be stored in this column. They'll be the subject of this chapter. Secondly, there are so-called key constraints. Primary keys, for example, uniquely identify each record, or row, of a database table. They'll be discussed in the next chapter. Lastly, there are referential integrity constraints. In short, they glue different database tables together. You'll learn about them in the last chapter of this course.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3264a6d1-78c3-4734-ac15-592e942f7f38"},{"source":"4. Data types as attribute constraints\n02:08 - 02:43\nYou'll start with attribute constraints in this chapter. In its simplest form, attribute constraints are data types that can be specified for each column of a table. Here you see the beginning of a list of all data types in PostgreSQL. There are basic data types for numbers, such as \"bigint\", or strings of characters, such as \"character varying\". There are also more high-level data types like \"cidr\", which can be used for IP addresses. Implementing such a type on a column would disallow anything that doesn't fit the structure of an IP.\n\n5. Dealing with data types (casting)\n02:43 - 03:23\nData types also restrict possible SQL operations on the stored data. For example, it is impossible to calculate a product from an integer *and* a text column, as shown here in the example. The text column \"wind_speed\" may store numbers, but PostgreSQL doesn't know how to use text in a calculation. The solution for this is type casts, that is, on-the-fly type conversions.

So there's no need for a surrogate key here. However, let's say there were only these three attributes in the table.

Adding a surrogate key with serial data type\n01:27 - 02:04\nYou could add a new surrogate key column, called \"id\", to solve this problem. Actually, there's a special data type in PostgreSQL that allows the addition of auto-incrementing numbers to an existing table: the \"serial\" type. It is specified just like any other data type. Once you add a column with the \"serial\" type, all the records in your table will be numbered. Whenever you add a new record to the table, it will automatically get a number that does not exist yet.

Model 1:N relationships with foreign keys**\n3. The next database model\n00:20 - 00:51\nNext up, you'll model a so-called relationship type between \"professors\" and \"universities\". As you know, in your database, each professor works for a university. In the ER diagram, this is drawn with a rhombus. The small numbers specify the cardinality of the relationship: a professor works for at most one university, while a university can have any number of professors working for it – even zero.\n\n4. Implementing relationships with foreign keys\n00:51 - 01:36\nSuch relationships are implemented with foreign keys. Foreign keys are designated columns that point to a primary key of another table. There are some restrictions for foreign keys. First, the domain and the data type must be the same as one of the primary key. Secondly, only foreign key values are allowed that exist as values in the primary key of the referenced table. This is the actual foreign key constraint, also called \"referential integrity\". You'll dig into referential integrity at the end of this chapter. Lastly, a foreign key is not necessarily an actual key, because duplicates and \"NULL\" values are allowed. Let's have a look at your database.\n\n5. A query\n01:36 - 02:16\nAs you can see, the column \"university_shortname\" of \"professors\" has the same domain as the \"id\" column of the \"universities\" table. If you go through each record of \"professors\", you can always find the respective \"id\" in the \"universities\" table. So both criteria for a foreign key in the table \"professors\" referencing \"universities\" are fulfilled. Also, you see that \"university_shortname\" is not really a key because there are duplicates. For example, the id \"EPF\" and \"UBE\" occur three times each.\n\n6. Specifying foreign keys\n02:16 - 03:10\nWhen you create a new table, you can specify a foreign key similarly to a primary key. Let's look at two example tables. First, we create a \"manufacturers\" table with a primary key called \"name\". Then we create a table \"cars\", that also has a primary key, called \"model\". As each car is produced by a certain manufacturer, it makes sense to also add a foreign key to this table. We do that by writing the \"REFERENCES\" keyword, followed by the referenced table and its primary key in brackets.

Model more complex relationships\n00:00 - 00:12\nIn the last few exercises, you made your first steps in modeling and implementing 1:N-relationships. Now it's time to look at more complex relationships between tables.\n\n2. The current database model\n00:12 - 00:56\nSo you've added a 1:N-relationship between professors and universities. Such relationships have to be implemented with one foreign key in the table that has at most one foreign entity associated. In this case, that's the \"professors\" table, as professors cannot have more than one university associated. Now, what about affiliations? We know that a professor can have more than one affiliation with organizations, for instance, as a chairman of a bank and as a president of a golf club. On the other hand, organizations can also have more than one professor connected to them. Let's look at the entity-relationship diagram that models this.\n\n3. The final database model\n00:56 - 01:52\nThere are a couple of things that are new. First of all, a new relationship between organizations and professors was added. This is an N:M relationship, not an 1:N relationship as with professors and universities. This depicts the fact that a professor can be affiliated with more than one organization and vice versa. Also, it has an own attribute, the function. Remember that each affiliation comes with a function, for instance, \"chairman\". The second thing you'll notice is that the affiliations entity type disappeared altogether. For clarity, I still included it in the diagram, but it's no longer needed. However, you'll still have four tables: Three for the entities \"professors\", \"universities\" and \"organizations\", and one for the N:M-relationship between \"professors\" and \"organizations\".\n\n4. How to implement N:M-relationships\n01:52 - 03:06\nSuch a relationship is implemented with an ordinary database table that contains two foreign keys that point to both connected entities. In this case, that's a foreign key pointing to the \"professors.id\" column, and one pointing to the \"organizations.id\" column. Also, additional attributes, in this case \"function\", need to be included. If you were to create that relationship table from scratch, you would define it as shown. Note that \"professor_id\" is stored as \"integer\", as the primary key it refers to has the type \"serial\", which is also an integer. On the other hand, \"organization_id\" has \"varchar(256)\" as type, conforming to the primary key in the \"organizations\" table. One last thing: Notice that no primary key is defined here because a professor can theoretically have multiple functions in one organization. One could define the combination of all three attributes as the primary key in order to have some form of unique constraint in that table, but that would be a bit over the top.\n\n5. Time to implement this!\n03:06 - 03:24\nSince you already have a pre-populated affiliations table, things are not going to be so straightforward.

Referential integrity\n00:00 - 00:08\nWe'll now talk about one of the most important concepts in database systems: referential integrity. It's a very simple concept...\n\n2. Referential integrity\n00:08 - 00:46\n...that states that a record referencing another record in another table must always refer to an existing record. In other words: A record in table A cannot point to a record in table B that does not exist. Referential integrity is a constraint that always concerns two tables, and is enforced through foreign keys, as you've seen in the previous lessons of this chapter. So if you define a foreign key in the table \"professors\" referencing the table \"universities\", referential integrity is held from \"professors\" to \"universities\".\n\n3. Referential integrity violations\n00:46 - 01:19\nReferential integrity can be violated in two ways. Let's say table A references table B. So if a record in table B that is already referenced from table A is deleted, you have a violation. On the other hand, if you try to insert a record in table A that refers to something that does not exist in table B, you also violate the principle. And that's the main reason for foreign keys – they will throw errors and stop you from accidentally doing these things.\n\n4. Dealing with violations\n01:19 - 02:08\nHowever, throwing an error is not the only option. If you specify a foreign key on a column, you can actually tell the database system what should happen if an entry in the referenced table is deleted. By default, the \"ON DELETE NO ACTION\" keyword is automatically appended to a foreign key definition, like in the example here. This means that if you try to delete a record in table B which is referenced from table A, the system will throw an error. However, there are other options. For example, there's the \"CASCADE\" option, which will first allow the deletion of the record in table B, and then will automatically delete all referencing records in table A. So that deletion is cascaded.\n\n5. Dealing with violations, contd.\n02:08 - 02:47\nThere are even more options. The \"RESTRICT\" option is almost identical to the \"NO ACTION\" option. The differences are technical and beyond the scope of this course. More interesting is the \"SET NULL\" option. It will set the value of the foreign key for this record to \"NULL\". The \"SET DEFAULT\" option only works if you have specified a default value for a column. It automatically changes the referencing column to a certain default value if the referenced record is deleted. Setting default values is also beyond the scope of this course, but this option is still good to know.\n\n6.
